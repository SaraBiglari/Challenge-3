# Challenge-3
D1 and D2 are two daemons. one of them works as server and the other is like a client
I found some codes for implementing a pair of server/client which use unix socket to communicate.

I tried to merge them with daemons code
so I think it works for this challenge that put these codes into the **process** function of Daemon

but I have some struggles for running them
there is some errors that I haven't resolved them yet.
